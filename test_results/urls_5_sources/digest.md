## Theme 3

- **Claim:** Federated learning (FL) enables gaining insights collaboratively without moving patient data beyond the firewalls of the institutions in which they reside.

## Theme 4

- **Claim:** Models trained by FL can achieve performance levels comparable to ones trained on centrally hosted data sets and superior to models that only see isolated single-institutional data.

## Theme 5

- **Claim:** A successful implementation of FL could hold a significant potential for enabling precision medicine at large-scale, leading to models that yield unbiased decisions, optimally reflect an individual’s physiology, and are sensitive to rare diseases while respecting governance and privacy concerns.
